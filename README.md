HOME FIELD ADVANTAGE

Purpose
Home field advantage is often talked about when teams play against rivals 
or make it to the playoffs. The purpose of this project is to determine 
how much of an advantage playing at home has. Using data 
from the 2012 - 2016 seasons for 3 major sports we will be able to determine the advantage for each team, which sports home field is more advantageous for, and which states have the best advantage.
